<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This app helps you determine the fund with the most investment potential based on key risk-management metrics: the daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and beta.

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples. -->

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Python CSV Reading/Writing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html)
* [Python pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Python matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Python conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)
* [Python JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

<!-- This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps. -->
* You don't need Python. You can install Anaconda and JupyterLab normally just like any other application on your computer. Follow the instructions for Anaconda, ensure that its working, then install JupyterLab.

* I have placed Comments throughout the code so that you can follow the code and be able to replicate the app on your own. Also, so that you're able to contribute in the future :-)

### Prerequisites

<!-- This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them. -->
A text editor such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)


### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AnaIitico/quantitative_analysis.git
   ```

2. You don't need to install pip - Conda comes with pip and you can also use the command
    conda install 'package name'
   
3. Install Conda according to the instructions based on your operating system.
    For windows users you MUST use the Administrator PowerShell. Users with AMD Processors MUST use the Administrator PowerShell 7 (X64) version
  
    Once installed Conda has an Admin PowerShell version shortcut - look on your Start menu for it.
    This shortcut will prove very useful at times when you need to install other apps or make adjustments to your installation

    Once installed you will see (base) on your terminal
   
4. Activate Conda Dev environment
   ```sh
   conda activate dev
   ```
   You should now see (dev) on your terminal

5. Install JupyterLabs
   ```sh
   pip install jupyterlab

6. Run JupyterLab
   ```sh
   jupyter lab
   ```
   A browser window should open on localhost:8889/lab

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

<!-- Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources. -->
This app helps you determine the fund with the most investment potential based on key risk-management metrics: the daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and beta.

It loads a database of 4 investment funds vs the S&P 500 and makes all calculations based on the code and the data. The csv file is located in the Resources folder.

<!-- #### Description
#### you can see the full code (with outputs) in the [risk_return_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/AnaIitico/quantitative_analysis/blob/main/risk_return_analysis.ipynb) file
  *This code has been summarized into one block for convenience*
  *and there's an analysis at the end*
```sh
  some cool code goes here
 ``` -->
